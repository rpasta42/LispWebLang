# README for LispWebLang

Welcome to LispWebLang, the new LISP for web development! LispWebLang is a modern, expressive, and powerful language designed to reimagine web development. It's a unified language that integrates the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single, coherent system focused on simplicity, performance, and developer experience.

Our goal is to address the pain points of traditional web development by offering native components, reactive state management, declarative bindings, scoped styling, an improved layout engine, integrated animations, and top-notch performance. All of this, alongside better error handling, debugging, and adherence to progressive enhancement principles, makes LispWebLang a compelling choice for modern web applications.

## Features

- **Unified Language**: Structure, style, and behavior are all part of a single language.
- **Components as First-Class Citizens**: Components are self-contained with their own state, logic, and styles.
- **Reactive State Management**: Built-in state management that reflects changes in the UI automatically.
- **Declarative Bindings**: Declare relationships between UI and data models effortlessly.
- **Styling with Scope and Variables**: Scoped styles and variables are built into the language.
- **Improved Layout Engine**: More intuitive and powerful layout definitions.
- **Integrated Animation and Interaction**: Core support for defining animations and interactions.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Designed with a focus on reducing unnecessary reflows and repaints.
- **Better Error Handling and Debugging**: Sophisticated tools and clear error messages.
- **Progressive Enhancement Principles**: Basic content is accessible, with enhancements for capable devices.

## Installation

_TODO: Instructions on how to install LispWebLang._

## Usage

To get started with LispWebLang, create a `.lwl` file and use the provided syntax and functions to define your web components and application logic. Here's an example of how to create a simple page:

```lisp
(define-page home
  (html
    (body
      (header (h1 "Welcome to LispWebLang"))
      (main
        (section :id "introduction"
          (p "This is a new era of web development."))))))
```

For more detailed examples, see the "examples" directory in this repository.

## Examples

Below are some illustrative examples to showcase LispWebLang's capabilities in action:

### 1. Unified Language
```lisp
(define-page home
  (html
    (head
      (title "My Home Page"))
    (body
      (header (h1 "Welcome to My Website"))
      (section :id "main-content"
        (style
          (:background-color "#f0f0f0")
          (:padding "20px"))
        (article
          (style
            (:border "1px solid #ddd")
            (:padding "15px"))
          (h2 "Article Title")
          (p "This is the main content of the article."))))))
```

### 2. Components as First-Class Citizens
```lisp
(define-component navbar
  (style
    (:background-color "black")
    (:color "white"))
  (ul
    (li (a :href "/" "Home"))
    (li (a :href "/about" "About"))
    (li (a :href "/contact" "Contact"))))

(define-page home
  (html
    (body
      (navbar))))
```

### 3. Reactive State Management
```lisp
(define-state page-title "My Home Page")

(define-component title-display
  (h1 (bind page-title)))

; When the state changes, the UI updates automatically.
(set! page-title "Welcome to My New Page")
```

### 4. Declarative Bindings
```lisp
(define-data user {:name "John Doe" :age 30})

(define-component user-profile
  (div
    (h2 (

bind user.name))
    (p (concat "Age: " (bind user.age)))))
```

### 5. Styling with Scope and Variables
```lisp
(define-style base-theme
  {:primary-color "#333"
   :padding "15px"})

(define-component button
  (style
    (:background-color (var base-theme.primary-color))
    (:padding (var base-theme.padding))
    (:border "none")
    (:color "white"))
  (button "Click Me"))
```

### 6. Improved Layout Engine
```lisp
(define-layout grid-layout
  (style
    (:display "grid")
    (:grid-template-columns "repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))"))
  (children))

(define-page home
  (grid-layout
    (div "Item 1")
    (div "Item 2")
    (div "Item 3")))
```

### 7. Integrated Animation and Interaction
```lisp
(define-animation slide-in
  (from
    (:transform "translateX(-100%)"))
  (to
    (:transform "translateX(0)")))

(define-component animated-div
  (div :class "slide-in" "This div slides in on load."))
```

### 8. Enhanced Performance
```lisp
(define-component large-list
  (virtual-scroll
    (items large-dataset)
    (item-template (lambda (item) (li (bind item))))))
```

### 9. Better Error Handling and Debugging
```lisp
(define-page home
  (try
    (html
      (body (malformed-component)))
    (catch (error)
      (console-log "Error rendering component:" error))))
```

### 10. Progressive Enhancement Principles
```lisp
(define-component image-with-fallback
  (picture
    (source :srcset "high-res.jpg" :media "(min-width: 800px)")
    (img :src "low-res.jpg" :alt "A description for accessibility")))

(define-page home
  (html
    (body
      (image-with-fallback))))
```

These examples are intended to provide a glimpse into the potential of LispWebLang for creating rich, interactive web applications with ease. They showcase the philosophy of integrating structure, style, and behavior into a cohesive development experience.
